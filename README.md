# Tab Saver
Tab Saver is Chrome extension that allows you to easily save an entire window's worth of browser tabs and open them later

## Usage
![alt text](https://github.com/HammerCar/Tab-Saver/raw/master/example.png "Example")

When clicking the Tab Saver icon at the top right of the browser the Tab Saver popup opens. Here the current window can be saved by entering a name and clicking "Save and Close". Below that are the already saved windows. These can be opened by clicking on the button that says "Open". Alternatively single tabs can be opened, but they won't be removed from the list.
